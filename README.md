- Details of the PWA is stored in the manifest.json which has the details about the extension

- Systeminfo API is used to fetch details from system
- background.js script file in extension folder is used to fetch system information
- content.js script file in extension folder is used to add the details to the web page
- Message passing is used for the communication between the PWA and chrome extension
